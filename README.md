### Compiling and packaging Throwing Bricks
1. Ensure that `Apache Ant` (found [here](http://ant.apache.org/)) is installed correctly on your system.
 * Linux users will need the latest version of astyle installed as well.
1. Create a base directory for the build
1. Clone the repository into `basedir/src/`
1. Copy the minecraft bin dir and minecraft_server.jar into `basedir/jars/`
1. Navigate to basedir/src in a shell and run `ant clean package` (this will take 2-5 minutes)
1. The compiled and obfuscated jars will be in basedir/build/dist

Your directory structure should look like this:
***

    basedir
    \- jars
     |- minecraft_server.jar
     \- bin
      |- minecraft.jar
      |- ...
    \- src
     |- Client
     |- Common
     |- ...
